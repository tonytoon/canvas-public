# canvas-public
## Assorted Python scripts used to manage a particularly large higher-ed instance of Canvas.

The scripts in here will largely rely on the excellent [canvasapi](https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi) which hides all the details of your REST calls and lets you focus on the logic of your code. It may or may not be difficult to slot these into your own management of a Canvas instance, given how tailored they are to my particular needs, but my hope is that it can at least be used as a source of known working example code to help people see how certain function calls need to be formatted, how certain things *can* be done, etc.
